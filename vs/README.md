# Create and Review GitHub Pull Requests in Visual Studio

Create, review and merge pull requests inside Visual Studio, with full source-tree and full file access, your favorite keybindings, built-in diff too, and code intelligence.

# Get Feedback on Work-in-Progress with Pre-PR Code Reviews

CodeStream's lightweight feedback requests let you get feedback on your changes regardless of the current state of your repo, without the friction of committing, pushing or issuing a pull request. Your teammates can review your changes right in their IDE, with full file context, and with no need to set aside their current work to switch branches or pull the latest.

CodeStream’s feedback requests are so easy that you can start doing them throughout the development process instead of waiting until the end. You’re a few days into a sprint and have some work stubbed out? Maybe some work that hasn’t even been committed. Get feedback on your work-in-progress so that you can identify and resolve issues early instead of saving those gotchas for when you need to get the code merged.

# Simplified Code Discussion

Rather than copying & pasting, CodeStream enables in-editor commenting on any code in your repository, with optional sharing to Slack, Teams or via email, with automatic at-mentioning of code authors via git blame.

Your teammates can participate in the discussion right from their IDE, or from Slack, Teams, or replying to the email.

# Build the Knowledge Base Behind Your Codebase

CodeStream turns conversation into documentation by capturing all of the discussion about your code, and saving it with your code. Comment and code review threads are automatically repositioned as your code changes, even across branches. All with zero effort on your part.

Previously discussed questions and issues that explain important decisions are now accessible right where you need them, when you need them. Just click on the codemark to expand it and see how something works or why something was done a certain way.

# Frequently Asked Questions

#### Where are messages stored?

Your team’s codemarks, which include the message text and the code snippet, are stored in the cloud on CodeStream’s servers. CodeStream uses best practices when it comes to [security](https://www.codestream.com/security), but if your team has stringent infosec requirements we also offer an [on-prem solution](https://docs.codestream.com/onprem/).
